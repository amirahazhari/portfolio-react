 # Design Meets Code — Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing my work as a **UI/UX Designer & Front-End Developer**, focused on thoughtful interfaces, interaction design, and clean implementation.

Built to demonstrate how **design and code work together** — from visual hierarchy and motion to component structure and performance.
